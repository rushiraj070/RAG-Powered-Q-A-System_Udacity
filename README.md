### 💡 Problem Statement

Navigating through large volumes of unstructured text to find specific answers can be time-consuming and inefficient. Traditional keyword search often falls short, missing contextually relevant information. This project addresses this challenge by enabling users to ask natural language questions and receive accurate, targeted answers directly from a provided knowledge base.

## 🧠 Solution Overview: Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)

This system is built upon a **Retrieval-Augmented Generation (RAG)** architecture. Here's how it works:

1.  **Embedding Generation:** Each document (or chunk of text) in the knowledge base is converted into a high-dimensional numerical representation called a **vector embedding** using OpenAI's `text-embedding-3-small` model. These embeddings capture the semantic meaning of the text.
2.  **Semantic Search:** When a user asks a question, its embedding is generated. This question embedding is then compared against all document embeddings using **cosine similarity** to find the most semantically relevant pieces of information from the knowledge base.
3.  **Contextual Prompting:** The top-ranked, most relevant document snippets are then combined with the user's original question to form a comprehensive prompt.
4.  **LLM Inference:** This context-rich prompt is fed to a powerful **Large Language Model (LLM)** like `gpt-3.5-turbo`. The LLM then generates a concise and accurate answer based *only* on the provided context, minimizing hallucinations and ensuring factual grounding.


### 🌟 Key Features

* **Contextual Question Answering:** Provides precise and accurate answers by retrieving information from a custom knowledge base.
* **Advanced Semantic Search:** Utilizes state-of-the-art OpenAI embedding models for highly relevant context retrieval.
* **Dynamic Contextualization:** Automatically identifies, ranks, and assembles the most pertinent document snippets to inform the LLM.
* **Efficient Token Management:** Integrates `tiktoken` to intelligently handle and respect token limits for both embedding and LLM calls, optimizing API usage.
* **Modular Python Implementation:** Designed with clean, maintainable, and reusable Python code.
* **Scalable Architecture:** Easily adaptable to larger datasets and different OpenAI models.

### 🚀 Quickstart

Follow these steps to set up and run the project locally.

### Prerequisites

* Python 3.8+
* An OpenAI API Key.

### 1. Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone [https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git](https://github.com/your-username/your-repo-name.git)
cd your-repo-name
```
*(Remember to replace `your-username/your-repo-name.git` and `your-repo-name` with your actual GitHub repository details.)*

### 2. Set Up Virtual Environment

It's highly recommended to use a virtual environment to manage dependencies:

```bash
python -m venv venv
# On Windows
.\venv\Scripts\activate
# On macOS/Linux
source venv/bin/activate
```

### 3. Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```
*(Ensure you have a `requirements.txt` file generated from your environment, e.g., using `pip freeze > requirements.txt`)*

### 4. Set Your OpenAI API Key

Set your OpenAI API key as an environment variable. This is the most secure way to handle your API key.

**On macOS/Linux:**

```bash
export OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

**On Windows (Command Prompt):**

```cmd
set OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
```

**On Windows (PowerShell):**

```powershell
$env:OPENAI_API_KEY="YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"
```
*(**Important:** Replace `"YOUR_OPENAI_API_KEY"` with your actual OpenAI API Key. **Do not commit your API key directly to your code or GitHub!** If you use a custom base URL like `https://openai.vocareum.com/v1`, you might hardcode it in the client initialization or add it as another environment variable.)*

### 5. Prepare Your Data

A sample dataset (`india_2024_events_sample.csv`) should be available in the `data/` directory. This is a small subset of the data used for the demonstration.

### 6. Run the Demo

You can run the interactive demo via a Jupyter Notebook or a Python script:

#### Option A: Jupyter Notebook (for interactive exploration)

```bash
jupyter notebook notebooks/project_exploration.ipynb
```
*(Open the `project_exploration.ipynb` notebook and run the cells sequentially.)*

#### Option B: Python Script (for quick execution)

```bash
python src/main.py
```
*(This assumes you have a `main.py` script that orchestrates the Q&A process. If you don't have one, create it by putting the `client` initialization, `create_prompt`, `answer_question` functions, and example usage there.)*
